    <h1><br>exploreCSR 2022-2023: Diversity in Cybersecurity at UTK for Appalachia</h1>
    </div>

    <p>We have observed that a myriad number of companies have been attacked by adversaries, which resulted in tremendous financial loss. 
      Moreover, normal users have been targets of phishing and scams, and they have experienced financial loss as well.
      Cybersecurity becomes one of the most important areas in our daily lives since it helps protect organizations and individuals from cyber attacks,
      and prevent data breaches, identity theft, and other types of cybercrime.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, computer science specifically the cybersecurity area suffers from a lack of diversity.
      Particularly, students rooted in the <strong>Appalachian</strong> region and culture, especially in <strong>East Tennessee</strong>,
      have experienced significant challenges in being provided with substantial computer science (including cybersecurity) 
      education opportunities.
      Our goal is to provide undergraduate students in the <strong>Appalachian</strong> region and culture (East Tennessee) 
      with substantial cybersecurity education opportunities such as summer research internships.
      These opportunities can help them pursue graduate studies in cybersecurity.
      We are interested in applicants from colleges and universities in the <strong>Appalachian</strong> region and culture.

        <h4 class="featurette-heading">About The Program</h4>
        <p class="lead">Learn about research careers and experience.</p>
        <p>Our program consists of one workshop and a research project during the summer break. 
          You will get to see what research in cybersecurity involves and what career options are available 
          in this field!</p>

	<p><b>Who can apply:</b> Current undergraduate students who attend college at an institution in the U.S. Appalachian region 
    (East Tennessee, North Carolina, Southern Virginia, and West Virginia). 
    We will host some in-person visits to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and will cover your travel costs.</p>

	<p><b>Experience needed:</b> Prospective students should have completed an introductory computer
	science course sequence. Coursework in cybersecurity is helpful, but not strictly required.
	No prior research experience is necessary.</p>

	<p><b>Research project:</b> Participants will be guided by Dr. Doowon Kim and working with his Ph.D. students on cybersecurity projects
    during the summer break (June - July). These include literature reviews, being involved in our existing research projects, or 
    new independent research projects.</p>

	<p><b>Time commitment:</b> The summer research internship runs during the summer break (June - July). 
    Participants are expected to commit four hours a day (20 hours a week) for eight weeks to participate in the research projects.</p>

	<p><b>Payment:</b> Each participant will be paid $15 a hour.</p>
